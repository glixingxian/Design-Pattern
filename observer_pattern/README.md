# Observer Pattern

Observer pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as **if one object is modified**, **its depenedent objects will be notified automatically**.

A simple exemple:

You get today the score of your exam, all the ones who cares about your result, for exemple, your parents will be notified automatically this score and prepare a "surprise" before you get home. Not only this time but also everytime a new score you get, they will be notified. They are "obersvering" your socre.
