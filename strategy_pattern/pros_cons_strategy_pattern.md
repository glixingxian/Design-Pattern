# Pros Cons Strategy Pattern

Pros:

1. Client can choose one strategy to use without affecting the system. It's also so flexiable to add a new strategy.
2. It gives an idea to avoid use "extend"
3. It avoids to use "if else"

Cons:

1. Client needs to know all the Strategies and choose which one to use by itself.
2. It could create many Strategy Classes.
