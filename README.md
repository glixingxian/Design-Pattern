# Design Pattern

Reading Link: To Add

This is an open-source git book to present Design Patterns. I'm so lost when I began to learn it. So I start to write this book to note all the things I learnt in my way and with my own understanding which could be easier for the beginers.

I'm a newbie on both Design Patterns and English. Any corrections or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
