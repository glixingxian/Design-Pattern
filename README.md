# Design Pattern

Published on gitbook: [Reading](https://www.gitbook.com/book/dongchuan/design-pattern/details)

Held on gitbook: [Contribute](https://github.com/DONGChuan/Design-Pattern)

This is an open-source gitbook to present Design Patterns. All the exemples in this book are now writen in Java (Could be more with your contribution :D ). This book will be updated weekly until all the patterns are well presented for newbies. Welcome to join us.

# Why I created this book

I was so lost when I began to learn it. So I start to write this book to note all the things I learnt in my way and with my own understanding which could be easier for some beginers like me.

I'm a newbie on both Design Patterns and English. Any corrections or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
